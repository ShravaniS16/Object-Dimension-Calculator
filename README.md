# Object-Dimension-Calculator
This Python script calculates object dimensions in centimeters using OpenCV. A reference coin with a known diameter determines the pixel-to-metric ratio. Users can select a region of interest (ROI) for measurement. It detects contours, approximates shapes, and calculates dimensions with visual feedback.
