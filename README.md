# Object-Dimension-Calculator
This Python script calculates object dimensions in centimeters using OpenCV. A reference coin with a known diameter determines the pixel-to-metric ratio. Users can select a region of interest (ROI) for measurement. It detects contours, approximates shapes, and calculates dimensions with visual feedback.
An OpenCV-based solution to calculate the dimensions of objects by processing images
with a reference object.
Applicable in environments such as conveyor belts, where precise dimension measurement is difficult to achieve
manually.
